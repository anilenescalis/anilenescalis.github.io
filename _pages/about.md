Greetings! ðŸ‘‹


I work as an IT Platform Engineer and SRE Engineer, and I would like to share my experiences with you. In this role, I am heavily involved in designing, managing, and ensuring the continuity of IT infrastructure. I have a particular interest in areas such as Kubernetes, Microservices, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and system security. These interests constantly drive me to explore and evolve with new technologies. 

Now, let me provide you with more information about my areas of interest and work experiences.

**Kubernetes and Microservices:**
Kubernetes and Microservices are crucial technologies for the deployment and management of modern software applications. The Microservices architecture replaces large monolithic applications with smaller, independent services. This allows applications to be more flexible, scalable, and developed independently by different teams. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an orchestration tool that automates the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of these microservices. By specializing in Kubernetes and Microservices, I contribute to organizations in delivering efficient and high-performance applications.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
IaC is an approach that defines and manages infrastructure resources through code. Rather than manually configuring infrastructure, IaC involves defining it in a code-based format and automating the provisioning process. Tools like Terraform and Ansible embrace IaC principles, enabling the creation and management of infrastructure in a repeatable and consistent manner. By working with IaC, I contribute to the creation of a more reliable and rapidly manageable infrastructure.

**Work Environment and New Technologies:**
The world of technology is constantly changing and evolving. This is why it is essential to keep up with new technologies and continuously improve our work environment. One of my interests lies in this area; I am constantly researching and experimenting with new technologies and proposing ways to make our working environment more efficient and productive. By collaborating with my colleagues, I aim to embrace and experience the latest technologies, making a difference in our work.

**System Security and Continuity:**
System security and continuity are other important areas in which I work as an IT Platform Engineer and SRE Engineer. Ensuring the security of the infrastructure, implementing defense mechanisms against security threats, and minimizing service disruptions are some of our core responsibilities. This involves strengthening authentication and authorization processes, configuring security firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. Additionally, I continuously manage backup and recovery plans to ensure the continuity of systems.

See you around!
