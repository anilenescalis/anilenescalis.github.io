## Secure Kubernetes Probing: Checking and Rotating Certificates
In a Kubernetes cluster, certificates play a crucial role in securing communications between various components. Regularly checking and rotating these certificates is essential to maintain a robust and secure environment. In this blog post, we will explore a set of commands that allow you to check the health of Kubernetes components using certificates and force the rotation of certificates if needed. Let's dive in!

## Check Certificates
The first set of commands enables you to verify the health of the kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler components using their respective certificates.

```bash
(
curl  --cacert /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-controller-manager/kube-controller-manager.crt \
  https://127.0.0.1:10257/healthz >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  && echo "[OK] Kube Controller probe" \
  || echo "[FAIL] Kube Controller probe";

curl --cacert /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-scheduler/kube-scheduler.crt \
  https://127.0.0.1:10259/healthz >/dev/null 2>&1  \
  && echo "[OK] Scheduler probe" \
  || echo "[FAIL] Scheduler probe";
)
```

The above commands utilize cURL to send requests to the kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler APIs, using their respective certificate authorities (CAs) located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-controller-manager/kube-controller-manager.crt and /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-scheduler/kube-scheduler.crt. If the probes succeed, you will see an "[OK]" message for each component. Otherwise, a "[FAIL]" message will be displayed.

## Force Certificate Rotation
Certificate rotation is essential to maintain the security of your Kubernetes cluster. When certificate-related issues arise, it may be necessary to force the rotation of kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler certificates. The following commands demonstrate how to do this:

```bash
echo "Rotating kube-controller-manager certificate"
rm /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-controller-manager/kube-controller-manager.{crt,key}
crictl rm -f $(crictl ps -q --name kube-controller-manager)

echo "Rotating kube-scheduler certificate"
rm /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/kube-scheduler/kube-scheduler.{crt,key}
crictl rm -f $(crictl ps -q --name kube-scheduler)
```

The above commands delete the existing certificates and private keys for both kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. Afterward, the Kubernetes container runtime interface tool (crictl) is used to forcefully remove the running containers for these components. When Kubernetes detects that the certificates are missing, it will automatically regenerate new ones.

_Note:_ Make sure to perform certificate rotation carefully and only when necessary, as this process may temporarily disrupt the availability of the affected components.

## Conclusion
Regularly checking and rotating certificates in a Kubernetes cluster is a crucial security practice. In this blog post, we explored how to use certificates to check the health of kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. Additionally, we learned how to force certificate rotation in case of any issues. By incorporating these practices into your Kubernetes cluster management, you can enhance the overall security and reliability of your infrastructure. 

Happy Kubernetes administering! ðŸŽ‰
